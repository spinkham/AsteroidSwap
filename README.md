# AsteroidSwap
HTML game where you play as a communications transmission trying to get to a remote planet from earth.  A tap of the spacebar or screen changes your direction.
If you hit an asteroid or go off the top or bottom of the screen, you fail and have to reload the page.

Created for Global Game Jam 2017 with my son Noah contributing game, level, and art design.
